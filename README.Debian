linuxserver-firewall for Debian
-------------------------------

Rebuilt from scratch after a development machine hard drive died.

This package includes the REL3 release from Sourceforge, plus modifications
to fix a bug introduced in recent bash versions.

It also includes man pages, thanks to John McPherson.
Try 'man 8 linuxserver-firewall'.
